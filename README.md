A wonderful Javacript tutorial from John Resig is located at [http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/).

This is a plain copy of the sources for educational purposes with the following additions:

1. some inline docs
2. minor refactorings
3. modernizations (html5,jquery update)
4. a clear button to reset the output list
