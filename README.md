# javascript-tutorial

A wonderful Javacript tutorial from John Resig is located at [http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/](http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/).

This is a plain copy of the sources for educational purposes with the following additions:

1. some inline docs
2. minor refactorings
3. modernizations (html5,jquery update)
4. a clear button to reset the output list

All credits goes to: 

**The Grandmaster of all Javascript Ninjas** aka [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/about/) 

**NOTE:** Only page 51 requires a webserver to run correctly (at least with Chrome browser). All other pages work fine when you open index.html directly from the filesystem with your browser.

## The not-so-known Marvels of Github

Github supports static hosting. The url to a static file looks like this:
